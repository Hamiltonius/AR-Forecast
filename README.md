# AR Simulator

Simulated ML modeling of synthetic defense contracting data. Uses scikit-learn to explore patterns in overdue accounts receivable. Great for testing classification, regression, and time series on randomized financial scenarios.

Part of the Regulus fintech suite.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/Hamiltonius/AR-Forecast.git
cd AR-Forecast


2. (Optional, but recommended) Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt


3. Run the main script:

This will:
- Load or generate synthetic defense accounts receivable (AR) data.
- Train classification and regression models on overdue behavior.
- Output feature importance and forecast charts to interpret trends and AR risk.
